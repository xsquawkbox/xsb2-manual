What is XSquawkBox?
===================

XSquawkBox is a plugin for `X-Plane`_ that allows you to fly with traffic and 
ATC provided by the `VATSIM network`_.

What is the VATSIM Network?
===========================

From the `VATSIM network`_ website:

        VATSIM (short for the Virtual Air Traffic Simulation Network) is a
        completely free online platform which allows virtual pilots, wherever
        they are in the world, to connect their flight simulators into one
        shared virtual world. VATSIM also simulates air traffic control in this
        virtual world, creating the ultimate as-real-as-it-gets experience for
        you, the virtual aviation enthusiast.

What does this let me do (in broad terms)?
==========================================

XSquawkBox lets you fly using X-Plane, online, with other human pilots, with
human provided ATC services.
