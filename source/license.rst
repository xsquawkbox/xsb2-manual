   Product as provided to you by the Developer.

   **Limitations on Redistribution of Software Product**.  You may not 
   redistribute the Software Product in whole or part in any way without the

   **Agreement to Transfer of Data by Software Product**.  By installing, 
   copying, downloading, accessing or otherwise using the Software Product, you
   hereby grant permission to the transmission of certain data from your local
   Device to a host network's server hardware for use in online flight 
   simulation.  The data transmitted to a host network's server hardware shall
   be limited to various data and information from your flight simulator
   software program including, but not limited to, aircraft performance and
   location data generated by said simulator program.  In addition, you further
   agree to the transfer of your hard disk drive serial number and/or the serial
   number of your Ethernet card as well as the version number of the Software
   Product to the Developer each time you startup the Software Product.  No
   information other than data generated by your flight simulation software and
   the data expressly set forth herein which would personally identify you shall
   be subject to the terms of this paragraph.  However, the terms of this
   paragraph expressly exclude any information you provide via the Software
   Product for purposes of logging onto a particular host network.  The
   provision of any such information shall be governed by the terms and
   conditions of your membership with such host network.

   **Support Services**.  The Developer may, in his sole discretion, provide you
   with support services related to the Software Product ("Support Services").
   Use of Support Services is governed by the Developer's policies and programs
   described in the user manual, in "online" documentation, or in other
   Developer-provided materials.  Any supplemental software code provided to you
   as part of the Support Services shall be considered part of the Software
   Product and shall be subject to the terms and conditions of this EULA.  You
   acknowledge and agree that the Developer may use technical information you
   provide as part of the Support Services for his business purposes, including
   for product support and development.  The Developer will not utilize such
   technical information in a form that personally identifies you.  

   **Software Transfer**.  Except as specified in this section, you may make a
   one-time permanent transfer of the EULA and Software Product directly and
   only to an end user.  This transfer must include all of the Software Product
   (including all component parts, the media and printed materials, any 
   upgrades, and this EULA).  Such transfer may not be by way of consignment or
   any other indirect transfer.  The transferee of such one-time transfer must
   agree to comply with the terms of this EULA, including the obligation not to
   further transfer this EULA and Software Product.  Subscription Products, if
   any are provided or otherwise made available, are non-transferable.

   **Termination**. Without prejudice to any other rights, the Developer may,
   in his sole discretion, terminate this EULA if you fail to comply with the
   terms and conditions herein.  In such event, you must immediately destroy all
   copies of the Software Product and all of its component parts.

3. **UPGRADES**.  If the Software Product is labeled as an upgrade, you must be 
   properly licensed to use a product identified by the Developer as being 
   eligible for the upgrade in order to use the Software Product.  A Software 
   Product labeled as an upgrade replaces or supplements (and may disable) the 
   product that formed the basis for your eligibility for the upgrade.  You may 
   use the resulting upgraded product only in accordance with the terms of this 
   EULA.  If the Software Product is an upgrade of a component of a package of 
   software programs that you licensed as a single product, the Software Product 
   may be used only as part of that single product package and may not be 
   separated for use on more than one Device.

   The Software Product may offer automatic and/or user optional downloadable 
   upgrades.  If you agree to any such upgrades, then data files will be 
   downloaded which will replace the Software Product's originally installed
   data files.  Any such upgrades will be for data files only and will not
   include any executable files.

4. **INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS**.  All title and intellectual property rights
   in and to the Software Product (including but not limited to any images, 
   photographs, animations, video, audio, music, text, and "applets"
   incorporated into the Software Product), the accompanying printed materials
   and any copies of the Software Product are owned by the Developer or his 
   suppliers.  All title and intellectual property rights in and to the content
   that is not contained in the Software Product, but may be accessed through
   use of the Software Product, is the property of the respective content owners
   and may be protected by applicable copyright or other intellectual property
   laws and treaties.  This EULA grants you no rights to use such content.  If
   this Software Product contains documentation that is provided only in
   electronic form, you may print one copy of such electronic documentation.
   You may not copy the printed materials accompanying the Software Product for
   any other purpose including, but not limited to, redistribution without the
   express prior written consent of the Developer.

5. **BACKUP COPY**.  After installation of one copy of the Software Product 
   pursuant to this EULA, you may keep the original media on which the Software 
   Product was provided by the Developer solely for backup or archival purposes.  
   If the original media is required to use the Software Product on the Device, 
   you may make one copy of the Software Product solely for backup or archival 
   purposes.  Except as expressly provided in this EULA, you may not otherwise 
   make copies of the Software Product or the printed materials accompanying the 
   Software Product.

6. **APPLICABLE LAW**.  If you exercise this license in the United States, then
